# Credit-Card-Checker

The company that you work for suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers. 
In this project, you have the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards are valid. 
Every other clerk currently checks using pencil and paper, but youâ€™ll be optimizing the verification process using your knowledge of functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time. 
Unlike the other clerks, you can spend the rest of your time relaxing!

The purpose of validateCred() is to return true when an array contains digits of a valid credit card number and false when it is invalid. This function should NOT mutate the values of the original array.

The role of findInvalidCards() is to check through the nested array for which numbers are invalid, and return another nested array of invalid cards.

idInvalidCardCompanies() should return an array of companies that have mailed out cards with invalid numbers. 
This array should NOT contain duplicates, i.e. even if there are two invalid.

strToArr() accepts a string and converts it into an array of numbers like the initially provided arrays
