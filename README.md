# Codeacademy - Credit-Card-Checker (JS)

The company that you work for suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers. 
In this project, you have the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards are valid. 
Every other clerk currently checks using pencil and paper, but youâ€™ll be optimizing the verification process using your knowledge of functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time. 
Unlike the other clerks, you can spend the rest of your time relaxing!
